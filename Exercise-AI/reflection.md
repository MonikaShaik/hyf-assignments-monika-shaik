1. I learned from AI:
    - How to creat a button with changing colors.
    - What addEventListener is.
    - How to link JavaScript file to HTML.

2. I needed correct Copilot every time when I ask something. That was so annoying for me. Copilot creates new files without my asking and adding strange code what takes more time to clean than writing by myself. Chat GPT was more useful than Copilot for me.

3. For me the differents is: for learning Copilot is not creating new files and code with does not make sense for me. And is not good for learning and explaining my questions. Deffinitly I do not like it and I am not going to use now.

4. Three risks of relying too much on AI tools:
    - Lack on independent thinking.
    - Limitation of the programming learning process.
    - Lack of understending of the code and difficulty in identyfying and fixing errors.
