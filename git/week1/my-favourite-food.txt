🥟 Dumplings with Potatoes & Cottage Cheese
🧺 Ingredients
For the Dough

2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour

1 egg

½ cup (120 ml) warm water (or milk)

1 tbsp oil or melted butter

½ tsp salt

For the Filling

2 medium potatoes, peeled and boiled

1 cup (200 g) cottage cheese (or farmer’s cheese)

1 small onion, finely chopped and sautéed (optional but tasty)

Salt & pepper to taste

(Optional) a bit of dill or chives for flavor

For Serving

Melted butter

Fried onions or bacon bits

Sour cream

👩‍🍳 Instructions
1. Make the dough

In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt.

Add the egg and oil, then slowly pour in warm water while mixing.

Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic (about 5–7 minutes).

Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.

2. Prepare the filling

Mash the boiled potatoes while still warm.

Add cottage cheese, sautéed onion (if using), salt, pepper, and herbs.

Mix until smooth and taste for seasoning.

3. Shape the dumplings

Roll the dough thin (about 1/8 inch or 2–3 mm).

Cut circles using a cup or cookie cutter (about 3 inches / 7–8 cm wide).

Place 1 tsp of filling in the center of each circle.

Fold over into a half-moon shape and pinch the edges tightly to seal.
(Tip: lightly moisten edges with water if the dough is dry.)

4. Cook the dumplings

Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil.

Drop dumplings in batches — don’t overcrowd.

When they float to the surface, cook for another 2–3 minutes.

Remove with a slotted spoon and toss with melted butter to prevent sticking.
